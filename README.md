# arrayHopper
Given an array of Integers, finds the least amount of hops needed  to reach the end of the array.  A hop can only be forward a distance less than or equal to the current value in the array.
Example:
    [1,3,1,2,8,4,2,7,6,5,9] 
    Hops needed are 1->3->8 with eight allowing the end of the array to be reached
